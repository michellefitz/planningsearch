# Backlog

- **Google Maps API key for inline property imagery.** The detail sheet
  already renders Street View + aerial thumbnails when `VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY`
  is set at build time. To activate: Google Cloud project with billing →
  enable *Street View Static API* + *Maps Static API* → create a key
  restricted to the Vercel domain and those two APIs → add as
  `VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY` in Vercel env vars → redeploy. ($200/month free
  credit ≈ ~25k image loads; metadata checks are free.)

- **Applicant names for the four Dublin authorities.** The eplanning.ie
  backfill only covers Kildare; Dublin City / Fingal / DLR / South Dublin use
  agileapplications.ie, which needs its own scraper.

- **"Appealed" filter as an area-level contested signal.** Appeal fields are
  in the bulk dataset (unlike objections); a filter chip would let users see
  contested applications across the map.

- **Scheduled redeploy for data freshness.** The Vercel bundle only refreshes
  on deploy; a weekly cron (Vercel deploy hook) would keep the register data
  current without code changes.
